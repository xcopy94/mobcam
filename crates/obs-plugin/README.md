Use an iPhone or iPad running [Moblin](https://github.com/eerimoq/moblin) as a
low latency camera in OBS Studio over USB.

## Requirements

- OBS Studio 32.2 or newer.
- Moblin, with the stream URL set to `mobcam://localhost:7790`.
- Moblin's audio codec set to AAC.

The iPhone or iPad is connected over a USB cable, so the computer must be able
to talk to it. Each operating system needs something different for that; see the
install section below.

## Install

Every release is on the
[releases page](https://github.com/eerimoq/mobcam/releases). Download the
`mobcam-obs-plugin` file for your operating system and follow the steps below.
Quit OBS Studio before installing and start it again afterwards.

### Windows

The Apple Mobile Device Service is needed to talk to the iPhone or iPad. Both
the [Apple Devices](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9np83lwlpz9k) app from the 
Microsoft Store and [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) install it, so install
either one. Connect the device once, unlock it and tap Trust.

Then install the plugin:

1. Download `mobcam-obs-plugin-<version>-windows-x64-Installer.exe`.
2. Run it and accept the elevation prompt by clicking "More Info" and then "Run
   Anyway".
3. Select the folder OBS Studio is installed in, normally
   `C:\Program Files\obs-studio`. The installer suggests the folder it finds and
   warns if the selected one does not hold `bin\64bit\obs64.exe`. The plugin is
   installed into `obs-plugins\64bit` and `data\obs-plugins\mobcam` in that
   folder.

To install by hand instead, download
`mobcam-obs-plugin-<version>-windows-x64.zip` and unpack it into
`C:\ProgramData\obs-studio\plugins`, so that the plugin ends up in
`C:\ProgramData\obs-studio\plugins\mobcam\bin\64bit`.

Uninstall the plugin from Settings, Apps, Installed apps.

### Linux

`usbmuxd` is needed to talk to the iPhone or iPad. On Debian and Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt install usbmuxd
```

Then install the plugin. On Debian and Ubuntu, download
`mobcam-obs-plugin-<version>-x86_64-linux-gnu.deb` and install it:

```shell
sudo apt install ./mobcam-obs-plugin-<version>-x86_64-linux-gnu.deb
```

On other distributions, download
`mobcam-obs-plugin-<version>-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.xz` and unpack it into `/usr`:

```shell
sudo tar -xf mobcam-obs-plugin-<version>-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.xz -C /usr
```

Connect the device once, unlock it and tap Trust.

Both ways install the plugin for the distribution's OBS Studio. An OBS Studio
installed as a Flatpak or a Snap looks for its plugins inside its own sandbox
and will not find it.

Uninstall the package with `sudo apt remove mobcam-obs-plugin`, or, for the
tarball, remove `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/obs-plugins/mobcam.so` and
`/usr/share/obs/obs-plugins/mobcam`.

Earlier releases shipped the plugin and the virtual camera together in one
`mobcam` package. Installing this one replaces it.

### macOS

macOS 12 or newer. Nothing extra has to be installed to talk to the iPhone or
iPad.

1. Download `mobcam-obs-plugin-<version>-macos-universal.pkg`.
2. Open it and follow the installer. The plugin is signed and notarized, and is
   installed into `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins` for the
   current user.

The first time the device is connected, unlock it and tap Trust.

Uninstall the plugin by removing
`~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/mobcam.plugin`.

### Verifying the install

Start OBS Studio and add a source. The plugin loaded if `Mobcam` is in the list
of source types.
